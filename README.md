# **Overview**

This repository contains some C++ Vulkan programs that I've written as I learn the API. In each example I try to implement different real-time 3D graphics techniques.  

All the programs use the Win32 API for funcionality such as windows, input-handling, performance measurement, etc. Therefore, they are not cross-platform.

**Prerequisites**:  
- Windows 
- Latest Vulkan SDK 
- Visual Studio
  
**How to run**:  
Open the Visual Studio solution file `VulkanDemos.sln`, select the desired configurations, build and run.
